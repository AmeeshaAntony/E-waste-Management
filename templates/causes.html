    <h1>Causes of E-Waste</h1>
    <p>E-waste is generated due to various reasons. Here are some common causes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rapid technological advancements leading to frequent upgrades : The constant evolution of technology leads to shorter product lifecycles and frequent upgrades.</li>
        <li>Consumerism and Planned Obsolescence: The culture of consumerism encourages people to frequently replace their electronic devices in pursuit of the latest features and trends.</li>
        <li>Increased Affordability and Accessibility: The decreasing costs of electronic devices, coupled with their widespread availability, have made them more accessible to consumers worldwide.</li>
        <li>Disposal Practices: Improper disposal practices, such as landfilling and incineration, significantly contribute to e-waste accumulation.</li>
        <li>Built-in Non-Replaceable Batteries: Many modern electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are designed with non-replaceable batteries.</li>
        <li>Improper recycling practices and illegal dumping : Inadequate infrastructure for e-waste collection, recycling, and processing is a major contributing factor to the accumulation of electronic waste.</li>
        <li>Business and Institutional E-Waste: Commercial and institutional sectors, including businesses, educational institutions, and government agencies, also generate significant amounts of e-waste through the disposal of outdated equipment and infrastructure upgrades.</li>
    </ul>
